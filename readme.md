###### The current system is inefficient as it is time-consuming and that is the foremost thing we are looking ahead to reduce with our system. Through our system, all the current admin/student work would be moved online and students/parents would be able to accomplish any of the problem statements through the website/mobile application just through few clicks making it a smooth experience for everyone with no delay.
